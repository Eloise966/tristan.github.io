        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an ambitious mechanical engineering graduate with expertise in corrosion engineering, eager to learn and seize every possible opportunity. My passion for finding unusual ways to optimise solutions and automation naturally led me to mechanical engineering. Following in my father’s footsteps, I’ve always been fascinated by computers, software, and how systems are designed to work smarter, not harder. Mechanical engineering is where I am able to blend my love for technology, programming, and automotive systems.</p>
        <p>I was born in South Africa and travelled a long way to Australia to pursue my studies at RMIT in Bachelors of Engineering (Mechanical) (Hons). I studied for 4 years and took part in many extra-curricular activities. One of my major achievements is being a founding member of RMIT Engineers Australia Student Society (REASS) and serving as the student ambassador for Engineers Australia at RMIT. I completed my studies at the end of 2023 with my thesis focused on <em>"Modern Multi-story buildings have to be built of highest possible energy efficiency,"</em> obtaining a First Class Honours.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, you can find me working with Cathodic Protection Designs as a Corrosion Engineer at Corrosion Control Engineering (a member of the Eptec Group), supporting major pipeline projects across Australia and ensuring homes have their essential utilities.</p>
